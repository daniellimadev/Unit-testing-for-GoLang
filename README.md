# Unit Testing for GoLang

This repository demonstrates fundamental and advanced unit testing techniques in Go (Golang). It is designed to help developers understand how to write effective and idiomatic tests using Go's standard testing tools and practices.

## 🧪 Covered Topics

The following unit testing concepts are covered in this repository:

### ✅ Basic Unit Tests
- Writing simple test functions using `testing.T`
- Validating expected vs actual results
- Using subtests for grouping related test cases

### 📦 Table-Driven Tests
- Organizing multiple test cases in a single test using structs and loops
- Improving test readability and scalability

### ⚠️ Testing Errors
- Validating error messages and conditions
- Ensuring correct error handling logic

### ⏱️ Benchmark Tests
- Measuring performance using `testing.B`
- Writing benchmark functions and analyzing output

### 🧪 Mocks and Interfaces
- Mocking dependencies using interfaces
- Creating fake implementations for unit isolation

### 🧩 Code Coverage
- Running tests with coverage reports (`go test -cover`)
- Identifying untested branches in the code

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the tests:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/daniellimadev/Unit-testing-for-GoLang.git
cd Unit-testing-for-GoLang
go test ./... -v
```
